Network Watcher is [soketi](https://github.com/soketi/soketi)'s companion that scouts the memory to avoid memory depletion.

This project was meant to be deployed in the same Pod (as a sidecar container) with soketi. Network Watcher will continuously scan the memory usage for soketi containers and in case a specific threshold is reached, it will update the Kubernetes Pod's labels to avoid new connections from kicking in, while keeping the old ones active. You can find examples [in the documentation](https://rennokki.gitbook.io/soketi-docs/network-watcher/installation).

## ü§ù Supporting

soketi is meant to be free, forever. Having a good companion for developing real-time apps locally should not involve any third-party and having a reliable option to deploy behind a firewall makes soketi a good option.

Development is done by investing time, so any help coming is appreciated. You can sponsor the development via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/rennokki). üì¶
